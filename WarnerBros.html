                            <p class="movie-list-item-desc">inDriver is a ride-hailing service that allows users to negotiate the fare directly with the driver. Launched in 2012, it originated in Russia and has since expanded to various countries worldwide. Unlike traditional ride-hailing apps with fixed prices, inDriver lets passengers set their own fares and drivers can accept, decline, or counteroffer. This unique approach aims to provide flexibility and transparency to both passengers and drivers. The inDriver app also offers features such as real-time tracking, driver ratings, and payment options for a convenient and customizable ride experience.</p>
